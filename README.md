# K9-Web-Protection-Copy


I DO NOT OWN THIS SOFTWARE

This is a copy of K9 Web protection originally
published by Blue Coat.

I've added a few blocksites, and a setup on how to
confiure it to run on safemode. Unfortunely I've decided
not to upload my license since I dont know if it'll be flagged
and wont be able to use it. 

If anyone finds a way to generate licenes feel free to create a PR
or link this repo as reference

Its really sad that they decided to stop supporting this software 
since it was quite effective

I dont really know of any other software that can block pornographic content
in safemode with networking (Windows).

Stay strong

Guys I found the SMTP server this is the site: https://www.k9webprotection.com/license.jsp
just enter your credentials here and you'll get a license :)
